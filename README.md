# Exploring Gini Coefficient Productivity Relationship in Major Economies

This Python/Pandas program explores the relationship between Gini coefficient, GDP per capita, GDP per employee, and GDP per hours worked.

![Gini Coefficient](https://www.laits.utexas.edu/lawdem/unit03/reading2/Gini_definition.jpg)

The real relationship between inequality and growth is probably buried by important confounding factors. Namely, there are powerful exogenous variables like globalisation that, by influencing inequality and growth to move in tandem, might cancel out a possible tendency of inequality to depress growth.

We wouldnâ€™t hold out for a non-trivial coorelationship

Ultimately, the result will probably be something like, while common sense holds that pronounced inequality can hurt growth by eroding equality of opportunity, our study holds that a straightforward Gini-GDP growth chart is not sufficient in its own to establish a central tendency. That said, a closer look at the specific macroeconomic histories of some of the countries we covered give basis for some further speculation...

Notably, many countries with already very serious Gini conditions had negative relationships, whereas those that had positive relationships tended strongly to be very Gini-healthy European/Nordic countries and thus presumably did not encounter the most societally disfiguring consequences of inequality growth.

Contrast this with Mexico Brazil Chile which are all sort of canonical examples of high inequality countries and had strong negative correlations between GDP per capita and Gini coefficient.
